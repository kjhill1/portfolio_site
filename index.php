    <h2>This is my WONDERFUL Portal Page and a little about me!</h2>

    <p>Wouldn’t the obligatory “About Me” that is shameless self-promotion be so much more interesting if there was a geeky joke right at top…of course! Um, YEAH! How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb???</p>
    <p>Now if you want to know how many, you will have to read about me!</p>

    <h2>Me</h2>

    <p>I love to design but I also love to code! Watching a concept realized into an experience is almost rewarding as popping bubble wrap</p>

    <p>I have combined my background in art, design, marketing, and client based project management with tech to become a UX/UI designer. Through my experience, I can design and build protosites, as well as fully functional websites. I have a clear understanding and the abilities to work through the full formal UX/UI Design Process.</p>
    <p>And I like cats, soapmaking, traveling and food.</p>

    <p>So, good Job, you made it to the end and your reward: None…..It's a hardware problem of course!</p>
